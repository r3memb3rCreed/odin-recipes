            <em> A pepperoni pizza is a classic and popular type of pizza that 
                is enjoyed by many pizza lovers around the world. It typically consists of a circular-shaped crust made from dough that is crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. 
                The crust is then topped with a layer of tangy tomato sauce, followed by a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese.</em>

            <em>
                The star of the show is the pepperoni, a type of spicy Italian sausage made from cured pork or beef. The pepperoni slices are placed evenly across the pizza, covering the cheese and adding a delicious and slightly spicy flavor to each bite.
                The pepperoni slices often curl up and become crispy around the edges when cooked, enhancing the texture and taste of the pizza.

                While the crust, sauce, cheese, and pepperoni are the main components, additional toppings such as herbs, spices, and vegetables can be added based on personal preference. Some common options include sliced onions, green peppers, black olives, mushrooms, or even extra cheese.

            <em>
                Once the pizza is assembled, it is baked in a hot oven until the cheese melts and becomes bubbly, and the crust turns golden brown. The result is a mouthwatering combination of flavors and textures—a savory and tangy tomato sauce, gooey melted cheese, crispy and slightly spicy pepperoni, all resting on a perfectly baked crust.

            <em>
                Pepperoni pizza is often served as a whole pie, which can be sliced into individual portions for sharing or enjoyed as a single serving. It is a beloved choice for casual meals, parties, movie nights, and whenever one craves a satisfying and comforting slice of pizza.

        <h4>Steps -</h4>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease two 12-inch pizza pans.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Make sauce: Whisk together water, tomato paste, oregano, basil, garlic powder, onion powder, sugar, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl until smooth. Set aside.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Make crust: Combine 2 cups flour, yeast, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Add warm water and oil; mix until well blended, about 1 minute. Gradually add remaining flour, a little at a time, until a soft, sticky dough forms.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Transfer dough to a floured surface; knead until dough is smooth and elastic, about 4 minutes. Add more flour as needed. (If using RapidRise yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.)</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Divide dough in half. Lightly flour your hands, then pat each piece of dough onto the prepared pizza pans.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Top dough with sauce, cheese, pepperoni.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Bake in the preheated oven until crusts are browned and cheese is bubbly, 18 to 20 minutes. Rotate pizza pans between the top and bottom oven racks halfway through baking.</strong></li>
        </ol>
