                    <em>Fried rice is a flavorful and versatile dish that is commonly found in various Asian cuisines. It is made by stir-frying cooked rice with a combination of vegetables, proteins, seasonings, and sometimes sauces. The result is a delicious and satisfying one-pot meal.</em>

                    <em> To prepare fried rice, leftover cooked rice is often used because it has a drier texture, which helps to prevent the dish from becoming too mushy. The rice grains should be separated and cooled before cooking to ensure that they do not clump together during the stir-frying process. </em>

                    <em>In a hot wok or large frying pan, oil is heated, and diced onions, garlic, and other aromatics are sautéed until fragrant. Vegetables such as carrots, peas, bell peppers, and corn are commonly added and stir-fried until they are cooked but still retain a slight crunch.</em>

The rice is stirred and tossed with the other ingredients, ensuring that it is coated with the flavors from the aromatics, vegetables, and proteins. At this point, soy sauce, oyster sauce, or other seasonings can be added to enhance the taste and give the fried rice its signature savory flavor. Some variations may also include scrambled eggs, which are cooked separately and then mixed into the rice.</em>
